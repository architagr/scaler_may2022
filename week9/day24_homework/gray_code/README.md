The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer A representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code.

A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 16
```

###### input format

```

```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = 2
# output 1: 
    [0, 1, 3, 2]
# input 2 :
