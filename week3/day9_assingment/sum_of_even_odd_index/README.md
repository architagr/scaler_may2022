# Problem Description

Given an array, **arr[]** of size **N**, the task is to find the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= n <= 10^5
-10^5 <= A[i] <= 10^5
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument contains an array A of integers of size N
```

###### Output Format

```
Return the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A=[2, 1, 6, 4]
# output 1: 
    1
# input 2 : 
    A = [2, 2, 2]
# output 2: 
    3
```
