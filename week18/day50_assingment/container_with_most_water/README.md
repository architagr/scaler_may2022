# Problem Description

Given n non-negative integers A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-1] , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, A[i]).

N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, A[i]) and (i, 0).

Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.

###### Problem Constraints

```
0 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= A[i] <= 10^5
```

###### input format

``` 
Single Argument representing a 1-D array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return single Integer denoting the maximum area you can obtain.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = [1, 5, 4, 3]
# output 1: 
    6
# input 2: 
    A = [1]
# output 2: 
    0
```
