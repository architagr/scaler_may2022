# Problem Description

You are given an integer **T** (number of test cases). You are given array **A** and an integer **B** for each test case. You have to tell whether **B** is present in array **A** or not.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= T <= 10

1 <= |A| <= 105

1 <= A[i], B <= 109
```

###### input format

``` 
First line of the input contains a single integer T.

Next, each of the test case consists of 2 lines:

First line begins with an integer |A| denoting the length of array, and then |A| integers denote the array elements.
Second line contains a single integer B
```

###### Output Format

```
For each test case, print on a separate line 1 if the element exists, else print 0.

```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    1 
    5 4 1 5 9 1
    5
# output 1: 
    1
# input 2 : 
    1
    3 7 7 2
    1 
# output 2: 
    0
```
