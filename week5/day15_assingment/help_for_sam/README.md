# Problem Description

Alex and Sam are good friends. Alex is doing a lot of programming these days. He has set a target score of **A** for himself.
Initially, Alex's score was zero. Alex can double his score by doing a question, or Alex can seek help from Sam for doing questions that will contribute **1** to Alex's score. Alex wants his score to be precisely **A.** Also, he does not want to take much help from Sam.

Find and return the minimum number of times Alex needs to take help from Sam to achieve a score of **A**.
