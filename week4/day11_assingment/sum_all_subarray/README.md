# Problem Description

You are given an integer array **A** of length **N**.
You have to find the sum of all subarray sums of A.
More formally, a subarray is defined as a contiguous part of an array which we can obtain by deleting zero or more elements from either end of the array.
A subarray sum denotes the sum of all the elements of that subarray.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Ai <= 10^4
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument is the integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a single integer denoting the sum of all subarray sums of the given array.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [1,2,3]
# output 1: 
    20
# input 2 : 
    A = [2,1,3]
# output 2: 
    19
```
