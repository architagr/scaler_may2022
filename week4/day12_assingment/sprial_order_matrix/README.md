# Problem Description

Given an integer **A**, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to A2 in spiral order.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 1000
```

###### input format

``` 
First and only argument is integer A
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a 2-D matrix which consists of the elements in spiral order.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    4
# output 1: 
    [[1,  2,  3, 4],
     [12, 13, 14, 5],
     [11, 16, 15, 6],
