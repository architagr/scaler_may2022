# Problem Description

Given two integer arrays, **A** and **B** of size **N** and **M**, respectively. Your task is to find all the **common elements** in both the array.

**NOTE:**

1. Each element in the result should appear as many times as it appears in both arrays.
2. The result can be in any order.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N, M <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer array A of size N.

Second argument is an integer array B of size M.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer array denoting the common elements.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
    B = [2, 3, 1, 2]
# output 1: 
    [1, 2, 2]
# input 2 : 
    A = [2, 1, 4, 10]
    B = [3, 6, 2, 10, 10]
# output 2: 
    [2, 10]
```
