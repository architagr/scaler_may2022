# Problem Description

Given two integers A and B. Find the value of A-1 mod B where B is a prime number and gcd(A, B) = 1.

A-1 mod B is also known as modular multiplicative inverse of A under modulo B.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 10^9
1<= B <= 10^9
B is a prime number
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer denoting the modulor inverse
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = 3
    B = 5
# output 1: 
    2
# input 2 : 
    A = 6
    B = 23
# output 2: 
    4
```
