# Problem Description

Given an integer **A**. Unset **B** bits from the right of **A** in binary.
For eg:-
A = 93, B = 4
A in binary = 1011101
A should become = 1010000 = 80. Therefore return 80.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 10^18
1 <= B <= 60
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument is a single integer A.
The second argument is a single integer B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return the number with B unset bits from the right.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = 25
    B = 3
# output 1: 
    24
# input 2 : 
    A = 37
    B = 3
# output 2: 
    32
```
