# Problem Description

Given a string **A**, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Note:** Users are expected to solve in O(N) time complexity.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= size(A) <= 10^6
String consists of lowerCase,upperCase characters and digits are also present in the string A.
```

###### input format

``` 
Single Argument representing string A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer denoting the maximum possible length of substring without repeating characters.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = "abcabcbb"
# output 1: 
    3
# input 2: 
    A = "AaaA"
