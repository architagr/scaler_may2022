# Problem Description

Merge two sorted linked lists, **A** and **B**, and return it as a new list.

The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists and should also be sorted.

###### Problem Constraints

```
0 <= |A|, |B| <= 10^5
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument of input contains a pointer to the head of linked list A.

The second argument of input contains a pointer to the head of linked list B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a pointer to the head of the merged linked list.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = 5 -> 8 -> 20
    B = 4 -> 11 -> 15 
# output 1: 
    4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20 
```
