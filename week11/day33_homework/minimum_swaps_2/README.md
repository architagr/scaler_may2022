# Problem Description

Given an array of integers **A** and an integer **B**, find and return the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to **B** together.

**Note:** It is possible to swap any two elements, not necessarily consecutive.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= length of the array <= 100000
-10^9 <= A[i], B <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return the minimum number of swaps.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
     A = [1, 12, 10, 3, 14, 10, 5]
    B = 8
# output 1: 
    2
```
