# Problem Description

You are given an array of integers of **N** size.

You have to find that there is any subsequence exists or not whose sum is equal to **B.**

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 20
1 <= A[i] <= 100000
0 <= B <= 1e9
```

###### input format

``` 
First Argument is array of integers A
Second Argument is B
```

###### Output Format

```
Return 1 if any subsequence sum is equal to B otherwise return 0.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
  A=[1,20,13,4,5]
  B=18
# output 1: 
  1
# input 2 : 
  A=[2,2,2,2]
  B=5   
# output 2: 
  0
```
