# Problem Description

Given an array of positive integers A, two integers appear only once, and all the other integers appear twice.
Find the two integers that appear only once.

###### Problem Constraints

```
2 <= |A| <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument is an array of integers of size N.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an array of two integers that appear only once.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4]
# output 1: 
    [3, 4]
# input 2 : 
    A = [1, 2]
# output 2:
