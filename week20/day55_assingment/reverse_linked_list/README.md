1 <= Length of linked list <= 10^5

Value of each node is within the range of a 32-bit integer.
```

###### input format

``` 
First and only argument is a linked-list node A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a linked-list node denoting the head of the reversed linked list.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL 
# output 1: 
    5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
