# Problem Description

Given an array of integers **A**, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

**NOTE:** Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

###### Problem Constraints

```
2 <= |A| <= 2000000

0 <= A[i] <= INTMAX
```

###### input format

``` 
The first and only argument of input contains an integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a single integer denoting the single element.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
# output 1: 
    3
# input 2 : 
    A = [1, 2, 2]
# output 2: 
    1
```
