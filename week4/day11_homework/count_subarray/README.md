# Problem Description

Given an array **A** of **N** non-negative numbers and a non-negative number **B**,
you need to find the **number of subarrays in A with a sum less than B.**
We may assume that there is no overflow.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= A[i] <= 1000
1 <= B <= 10^7
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer array A.
Second argument is an integer B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer denoting the number of subarrays in A having sum less than B.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [2, 5, 6]
    B = 10
# output 1: 
    4
# input 2 : 
    A = [1, 11, 2, 3, 15]
    B = 10
# output 2: 
    4
```
