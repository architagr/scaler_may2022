# Problem Description

Given an array with **N** objects colored **red, white, or blue**, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the **order red, white, and blue.**

We will use the integers **0, 1, and 2 to represent red, white, and blue,** respectively.

**Note:** Using the library sort function is not allowed.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 1000000
0 <= A[i] <= 2
```

###### input format

``` 
First and only argument of input contains an integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer array in asked order
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [0 1 2 0 1 2]
# output 1: 
    [0 0 1 1 2 2]
# input 2 : 
    A = [0]
# output 2: 
    [0]
```
