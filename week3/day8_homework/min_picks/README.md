###### Problem Constraints

```
2 <= N <= 1e5
-1e9 <= A[i] <= 1e9
There is atleast 1 odd and 1 even number in A
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument given is the integer array, A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return maximum among all even numbers of A - minimum among all odd numbers in A.

```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [0, 2, 9]
# output 1: 
    -7
# input 2 :
