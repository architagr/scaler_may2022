Implement **pow(A, B) % C.**
In other words, given **A, B** and **C, Find (AB % C).**

**Note:** The remainders on division cannot be negative. In other words, make sure the answer you return is non-negative.

###### Problem Constraints

```
-10^9 <= A <= 10^9
0 <= B <= 10^9
1 <= C <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
Given three integers A, B, C.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
   A = 2, B = 3, C = 3
# output 1: 
    2
```
