# Problem Description

You are given the root node of a binary tree **A**. You have to find the height of the given tree.

A binary tree's height is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= Number of nodes in the tree <= 10^5

0 <= Value of each node <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
The first and only argument is a tree node A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer denoting the height of the tree
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
 Values =  1 
          / \     
         4   3     
# output 1: 
    2
# input 2 : 
 
 Values =  1      
          / \     
         4   3                       
        /         
       2        
# output 2: 
    3
```
