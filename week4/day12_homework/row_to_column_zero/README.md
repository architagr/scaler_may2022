# Problem Description

You are given a 2D integer matrix A, make all the elements in a row or column zero if the A[i][j] = 0. Specifically, make entire ith row and jth column zero.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A.size() <= 10^3
1 <= A[i].size() <= 10^3
0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^3
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is a vector of vector of integers.(2D matrix).
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a vector of vector after doing required operations.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
[1,2,3,4]
[5,6,7,0]
[9,2,0,4]
# output 1: 
[1,2,0,0]
[0,0,0,0]
[0,0,0,0]

```
