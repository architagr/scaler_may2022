# Problem Description

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST).

Balanced tree : a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= length of array <= 100000
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a root node of the Binary Search Tree.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A : [1, 2, 3]
# output 1: 
      2
    /   \
   1     3
# input 2: 
    A : [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]
# output 2: 
      3
    /   \
   2     5
  /       \
 1         10
```
