# Problem Description

Given two binary trees, check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument is a root node of the first tree, A.

The second argument is a root node of the second tree, B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
   1       1
  / \     / \
 2   3   2   3
# output 1: 
    1
# input 2 : 
   1       1
  / \     / \
