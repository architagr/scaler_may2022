# Problem Description

You are given two strings, A and B, of size N and M, respectively.

You have to find the **count of all permutations of A present in B as a substring.** You can assume a string will have only lowercase letters.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N < M <= 10^5
```

###### input format

``` 
Given two arguments, A and B of type String.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a single integer, i.e., number of permutations of A present in B as a substring.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = "abc"
    B = "abcbacabc"
# output 1: 
    5
# input 2: 
    A = "aca"
    B = "acaa"
# output 2:
