# Problem Description

Given an array A of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= len(A) <= 100000
0 <= A[i] <= 2*10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument is an array of integers.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a string representing the largest number.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
# output 1: 
    "9534330"
# input 2 : 
    A = [2, 3, 9, 0]
# output 2: 
    "9320"
```
