# Problem Description

Little Ponny is given an array, **A**, of **N** integers. In a particular operation, he can set any element of the array equal to **-1**.

He wants your help in finding out the minimum number of operations required such that the maximum element of the resulting array is **B**. If it is not possible, then return **-1**.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= |A| <= 10^5

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument of input contains an integer array, A.

The second argument of input contains an integer, B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer representing the answer.

```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5]
    B = 3 
# output 1: 
    2
# input 2 : 
    A = [1, 4, 2]
    B = 3
# output 2: 
    -1
```
