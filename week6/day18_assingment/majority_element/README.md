# Problem Description

Given an array of size **N**, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exists in the array.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 5*10^5
1 <= num[i] <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
Only argument is an integer array.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
   [2, 1, 2]
# output 1: 
    2
# input 2 : 
    [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]
# output 2: 
    3 
# input 3 : 
    [1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 8, 2, 2]
# output 3:
