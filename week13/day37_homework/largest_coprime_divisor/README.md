# Problem Description

You are given two positive numbers A and B . You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A, B <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer maximum value of X as descibed above.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = 30
    B = 12
# output 1: 
    5
# input 2: 
    A = 5
    B = 10
# output 2: 
    1
```
