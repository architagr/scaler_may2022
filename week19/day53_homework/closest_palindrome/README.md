# Problem Description

Groot has a profound love for palindrome which is why he keeps fooling around with strings.
A palindrome string is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

Given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase alphabets, he wants to know if it is possible to make the given string a palindrome by changing exactly one of its character.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 10^5
```

###### input format

``` 
The first and only argument is a string A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return the string YES if it is possible to make the given string a palindrome by changing exactly 1 character. Else, it should return the string NO.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = "abbba"
# output 1: 
    YES
# input 2: 
    A = "adaddb"
# output 2: 
    NO
```
