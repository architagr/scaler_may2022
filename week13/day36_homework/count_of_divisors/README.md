# Problem Description

Given an array of integers **A**, find and return the **count of divisors** of each element of the array.

**NOTE:** The order of the resultant array should be the same as the input array.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= length of the array <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
```

###### input format

``` 
The only argument given is the integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return the count of divisors of each element of the array in the form of an array.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = [2, 3, 4, 5]
# output 1: 
    [2, 2, 3, 2]
# input 2: 
    A = [8, 9, 10]
# output 2: 
    [4, 3, 4]
```
