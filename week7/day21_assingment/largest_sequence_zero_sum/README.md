# Problem Description

Given an array **A** of **N** integers.

Find the largest continuous sequence in a array which sums to zero.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 10^6

-10^7 <= A[i] <= 10^7
```

###### input format

``` 
Single argument which is an integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an array denoting the longest continuous sequence with total sum of zero.

NOTE : If there are multiple correct answers, return the sequence which occurs first in the array.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    A = [1,2,-2,4,-4]
# output 1: 
    [2,-2,4,-4]
# input 2 : 
    A = [1,2,2,4,4]
# output 2: 
    []
```
