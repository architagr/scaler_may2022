# Problem Description

You are given a n x n 2D matrix **A** representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You need to do this in place.

**Note:** If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 1000
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is a 2D matrix A of integers
```

###### Output Format

```
Return the 2D rotated matrix.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1 : 
    [
        [1, 2],
        [3, 4]
    ]
# output 1: 
    [
        [3, 1],
        [4, 2]
    ]
# input 2 : 
    [
