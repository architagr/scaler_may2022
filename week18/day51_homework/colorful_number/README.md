# Problem Description

Given a number **A**, find if it is **COLORFUL** number or not.

If number **A** is a **COLORFUL** number return **1** else, return **0**.

What is a **COLORFUL** Number:

A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts. 
Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. 
And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= A <= 2 * 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
The first and only argument is an integer A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return 1 if integer A is COLORFUL else return 0.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = 23
# output 1: 
    1
# input 2: 
    A = 236
# output 2: 
    0
```
