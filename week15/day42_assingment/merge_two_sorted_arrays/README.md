# Problem Description

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B and A as one sorted array and return it as an output.

###### Problem Constraints

```
-10^10 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^10
```

###### input format

``` 
First Argument is a 1-D array representing A.

Second Argument is also a 1-D array representing B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return a 1-D vector which you got after merging A and B.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = [4, 7, 9 ]
    B = [2, 11, 19 ]
# output 1: 
    [2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 19]
# input 2: 
    A = [1]
    B = [2]
# output 2: 
    [1, 2]
```
