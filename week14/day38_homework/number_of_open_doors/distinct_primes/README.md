# Problem Description

You have given an array A having N integers. Let say G is the product of all elements of A.

You have to find the number of distinct prime divisors of G.

###### Problem Constraints

```
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
```

###### input format

``` 
The first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an Integer, i.e number of distinct prime divisors of G.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# output 1: 
    2
# input 2: 
    A = [1, 26, 13]
# output 2: 
    2
```
