# Problem Description

Given 2 non-negative integers A and B, find gcd(A, B)

GCD of 2 integers A and B is defined as the greatest integer 'g' such that 'g' is a divisor of both A and B. Both A and B fit in a 32 bit signed integer.

**Note:** DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTIONS.

###### Problem Constraints

```
0 <= A, B <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer denoting the gcd(A, B).
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = 4
    B = 6
# output 1: 
    2
# input 2: 
    A = 6
    B = 7
# output 2: 
    1
```
