# Problem Description

Given an integer array **A** of size **N**. You have to delete **one** element such that the GCD **Greatest common divisor)** of the remaining array is maximum.

Find the **maximum** value of GCD.

###### Problem Constraints

```
2 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
```

###### input format

``` 
First argument is an integer array A.
```

###### Output Format

```
Return an integer denoting the maximum value of GCD.
```

###### Example Input

```
# input 1: 
    A = [12, 15, 18]
# output 1: 
    6
# input 2: 
    A = [5, 15, 30]
# output 2:
